Allows posts/pages to be linked to addresses and display plotted on a Google Map in a sidebar widget

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add multiple addresses to a post/page and have those addresses automatically plotted on a Google Map in a sidebar widget. This is a great plugin to help localize your stories, events, news, etc.
Hovering over a plot will display the title of the post, address, and also a thumbnail from the post if any images exist. Easily add and delete a single or multiple addresses to each post/page. Viewing a single post/page displays only addresses attached to that post/page, viewing anything else will show the most recent plots across your entire site.
You can also set a custom title and description for each address saved. If no title or description is entered the post title and excerpt will be used.

Custom plot markers can be upload to the markers folder
